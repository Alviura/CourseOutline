    <h1>Course Outline</h1>
    <p class="p1">
        Well, its almost time for the "Real Deal" of this semester, the ultimate pressure of the academic sesson.That's right Exams. 
        So, are you prepared? Ok for me I would be capping if I said I'm ready for it(I'm dead ass not). So are you also felling the same? How are you 
        preparing to start studing?
    </p>
    <p class="p2">As the great scientist once said <i>"Bora course outline"</i> He really knew of what the future for comrades would look like.
        Indeed his statement was time relative (Hii humour ni ya the chosen few ). Well comrades, I have something that might alleviate
        your academic pressure.</p>
    <p class="p3">This is a collection of MCS (Math & CompScie) units that I have atleast a complete overview of the lectures that you
        have attended
